# USGS-Data-Grabber
This simply grabs all USGS sites in a list of counties (for now just Mecklenburg Co NC) and returns the instantaneous values as a geojson file. Check out the example at http://weather.uncc.edu/beta

In the future this will:

1. Allow user input of site location
2. Export 7-Day Charts for each site
3. Export additional datatypes (perhaps netcdf?)
